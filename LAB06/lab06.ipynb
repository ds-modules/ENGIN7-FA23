    "Groundwater is an important resource which provides water for municipal, agricultural, and industrial needs. Contamination from a variety of sources can diminish the quality of groundwater supplies, causing health problems for people who drink it or other problems, depending on the use. Modeling the motion of contaminants can allow us to use groundwater resources while preventing exposure to toxic contaminants. Modeling contaminant migration in groundwater requires computing groundwater velocity, which can be controlled by various soil properties, such as permeability. Permeability is a measure of how conductive a soil is to flow, and can vary by orders of magnitude over relatively short distances. (You can\n",
    "imagine that the permeability of sand will be much greater than that of clay, allowing water to flow through sand with significantly greater velocity.) In this question you will visually demonstrate the relationship between soil permeability, $k$, and groundwater velocity, $v$,.\n",

    "3. Display the spatial variability of groundwater velocity by plotting velocity vectors on the same plot as the filled contour plot. Use `quiver` to help you with the velocity plot.\n",
    "4. Often when analyzing data, transformations of the data can be a helpful tool for seeing the data in a new perspective and visualizing different trends. For instance, taking the logarithm of a dataset can take emphasis away from extreme values and more simply show overall variability. On a new figure, show a filled contour plot of the natural logarithm of permeability.\n",
    "5. Ensure that your plots are presentable (adjust the colorbar, shape and colors of the arrows, legend, title, axis as needed). Create a title and axis labels that make the content of your plots easy to understand on their own (without needed accompanying text). Note the axis values and ensure they match the appropriate field measurements. Hint: You need to convert your axis to adequately match the field scale measurements."
